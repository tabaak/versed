# VERSED — Style, Compared. 👟👕

A modern Flutter app for head-to-head outfit battles and curation. Built on Flutter, state-managed with Riverpod, and powered by Supabase for backend services, real-time votes, and media storage.

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack

* **Framework:** Flutter (iOS / Android)
* **State Management:** [Riverpod](https://riverpod.dev) (**Manual provider declaration only** — no code generation, `@riverpod`, or `build_runner`).
* **Backend & Auth:** [Supabase](https://supabase.com) (PostgreSQL, Supabase Auth with Google OAuth, Storage).
* **Navigation:** [GoRouter](https://pub.dev/packages/go_router) with declarative routes and Auth Guards.

## ✨ Features

* **Google Sign-In** — Supabase Auth with a native-feeling auth page (animated outfit matchup hero, Google-branded button). An `AuthGate` routes signed-out users to the auth page and signed-in users to the versus screen.
* **Versus battles** — the main screen pits two 4:5 outfit photos against each other in a diagonal layout (bottom-left vs top-right) with a VS badge at the seam:
  * **Tap** an outfit to pre-highlight it (subtle scale + brighter border, auto-clears after 1.5s).
  * **Double-tap** to crown the winner — it scales up with an accent glow while the loser dims, a small burst of emojis arcs and falls from the tap point, then the next pair fades in.
  * Graded haptic feedback (selection tick on tap, medium impact on the winning double-tap) and full reduce-motion support.

## 📁 Project Architecture

The ideal scaffold keeps the design system and showcase in the shared `core/` module, with each feature in its own module under `features/`:

lib/
├── core/                         # Shared app foundation
│   ├── l10n/                     # Localization (AppLocalizations)
│   ├── theme/                    # Design system (colors, typography)
│   ├── services/                 # Global services (Supabase, Storage)
│   ├── widgets/                  # Shared UI components (AppButton, loaders)
│   └── presentation/             # Core pages and showcase sections
│       ├── pages/
│       └── widgets/
├── features/
│   ├── auth/                     # Google sign-in, AuthGate, auth page
│   └── versus/                   # Outfit battle screen (VersusPage)

### Core Layering
1. `models/` — Pure Dart models (manual `fromJson`/`toJson`, `copyWith`, `operator ==`, and `hashCode`).
2. `services/` — Stateless Supabase queries and API calls.
3. `controllers/` — `Notifier` / `AsyncNotifier` for managing screen state.
4. `presentation/` — Screen pages (`pages/`) and reusable widgets (`widgets/`).
